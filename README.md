## Description

Looking to find some inspiration for your next tattoo? Look no further! 

In this application, our group worked to create an application where you can look up pictures for tattoo inspiration or use google maps to search tattoo shops in the city of your choice. The user can utilize the website without an account, or create and account in order to save pictures to their profile for later. If the user is unhappy with a photo they chose or end up getting it as their tattoo, they have the ability to delete it off their profile.
